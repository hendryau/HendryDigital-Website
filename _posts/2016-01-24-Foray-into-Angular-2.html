title: Foray into Angular 2
summary: A first try at the new version of Angular and TypeScript.
---

<p>I've been building Angular 1 apps since early last year, and anyone  who does anything remotely related to Angular has been hearing about Angular 2. Well, it seems to finally be happening. The beta was released last month, and the Angular dev team claims Angular 2 is ready for use in the wild. They released <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/">a great tutorial</a> to get people started. I decided it was time to dive in and give it a shot. </p>

<p>After running through the aforementioned tutorial, I agree... it's ready. Following the tutorial, I wrote up this <a href="https://github.com/hendryau/expr-builder-app">mathematical expression builder</a> component. Components are the bread and butter of Angular 2, as opposed to Angular 1's directives.</p>

<p>In playing with Angular 2, I also got to use TypeScript for the first time, and I must say, I really like it. Fearing the extra building steps, tooling, and dependencies, I was hesitant at first, but it's not bad at all. I can forsee it making me much more productive. Statically typed JavaScript is awesome. For those who are still leery, Angular 2 apps can be written in plain old JavaScript as well.</p>

<p>The mindset of a developer using Angular transcends whether you use version 1 or 2, so you're not really learning a new framework when you pick up version 2... you may be familiarizing yourself with the TypeScript syntax for the first time, but once you play with it a bit, you should be well on your way to writing fully fledged apps. All the fundamentals you learned developing Angular 1 apps can be carried right on over.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about giving React a test drive next, but I don't know if I will be able to pull myself away from Angular 2 anytime soon.</p>
